# Next.js workshop - App dir

During this workshop we will learn Next.js app dir basics, including:

- Streaming and suspense
- Routing - pages and layouts
- Data fetching

And more.

## Exercises

Our team decided to migrate this app from the Next.js basics workshop, from pages to app dir. You were assigned for the task.

Key considerations

- Use server components wherever possible
- The "AddToCart" component should "real-time" - use streaming here
